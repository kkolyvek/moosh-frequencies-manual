# Manual Shark Tail-Beat Frequency Processing

## About

This program is intended to aid in frequency estimations from video files.

## Usage

1. In `main.py`, declare the path to the video file you'd like to inspect.
2. Run the file from the terminal using `python main.py`.
3. When you'd like to begin tracking oscillations, press 'I'.
4. Press 'O' at the apex (points of maximum deflection, both positive and negative) of each oscillation.
5. To end tracking, press 'P'. This will end the video display and process keystroke inputs and provide a frequency estimation graph.
6. Press 'Q' at any point to end the video display without processing keystroke inputs.
